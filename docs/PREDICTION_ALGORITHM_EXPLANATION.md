## üîç **Step-by-Step Algorithm Process**

### **Phase 1: Data Collection & Analysis**

#### **1. Historical Performance Analysis**
```javascript
// Algorithm checks last 10 matches for both teams
const historicalAnalysis = {
    rodinaMoskva: {
        last10Matches: [
            // Recent match results, goals scored/conceded
            // Form patterns, home/away performance
        ],
        homeForm: "Recent home performance data",
        scoringPattern: "Average goals per match",
        defensiveRecord: "Clean sheets, goals conceded"
    },
    arsenalTula: {
        last10Matches: [
            // Similar analysis for away team
        ],
        awayForm: "Recent away performance data"
    }
};
```

#### **2. Head-to-Head Analysis**
```javascript
// Recent meetings between Rodina Moskva and Arsenal Tula
const headToHead = {
    recentMeetings: [
        // Last 5-10 meetings between these teams
        // Score patterns, playing styles
    ],
    averageGoals: "Typical goals in this fixture",
    homeAdvantage: "Historical home team performance"
};
```

#### **3. Current Form Assessment**
```javascript
// Last 5 matches analysis
const currentForm = {
    rodinaMoskva: {
        recent5Matches: [
            // W/L/D record, goals scored, defensive performance
        ],
        homeAdvantage: "Current season home record",
        motivation: "League position, relegation/promotion stakes"
    },
    arsenalTula: {
        recent5Matches: [
            // Away form, scoring away from home
        ],
        awayRecord: "Current season away performance"
    }
};
```

### **Phase 2: Statistical Analysis**

#### **4. Scoring Pattern Analysis**
```javascript
// Goals per match analysis
const scoringAnalysis = {
    rodinaMoskva: {
        averageGoalsScored: 1.2,
        averageGoalsConceded: 1.1,
        homeScoringRate: "Goals scored at home",
        defensiveStrength: "Goals conceded at home"
    },
    arsenalTula: {
        averageGoalsScored: 1.0,
        averageGoalsConceded: 1.3,
        awayScoringRate: "Goals scored away",
        defensiveRecord: "Goals conceded away"
    }
};
```

#### **5. Tactical Matchup Analysis**
```javascript
// Playing styles and tactical considerations
const tacticalAnalysis = {
    rodinaMoskva: {
        playingStyle: "Defensive/Attacking/Mixed",
        keyPlayers: "Injuries, suspensions, form",
        tacticalAdvantage: "Home advantage, familiar conditions"
    },
    arsenalTula: {
        playingStyle: "Counter-attack/Possession/High-press",
        awayStrategy: "Typical away approach",
        tacticalChallenges: "Playing away, unfamiliar conditions"
    }
};
```

### **Phase 3: AI Prediction Generation**

#### **6. Enhanced Prompt Processing**
```javascript
// The AI receives this comprehensive prompt:
const prompt = `You are an expert football analyst with deep knowledge of football tactics, team dynamics, and statistical analysis.

ANALYZE THIS MATCH: Rodina Moskva vs Arsenal Tula in First League (Russia).

CRITICAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Historical Performance: Consider last 10 matches for both teams
2. Head-to-Head: Recent meetings between these teams
3. Home/Away Form: Current season home/away performance
4. Injury Analysis: Key player availability and impact
5. Tactical Matchup: Playing styles and tactical advantages
6. League Context: Current league position and motivation
7. Recent Form: Performance in last 5 matches
8. Goalscoring Patterns: Average goals scored/conceded
9. Defensive Strength: Clean sheets and defensive record
10. Set Piece Efficiency: Corner and free-kick conversion rates

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- Base predictions on statistical evidence, not gut feeling
- Consider current form more heavily than historical data
- Factor in home advantage for home team
- Account for team motivation and league context
- Be conservative with high-scoring predictions
- Consider defensive records and playing styles`;
```

#### **7. Probability Calculation**
```javascript
// AI generates probabilities based on analysis
const prediction = {
    homeWinProbability: 35,    // Based on home form, historical data
    drawProbability: 30,       // Based on defensive records, scoring patterns
    awayWinProbability: 35,    // Based on away form, head-to-head
    
    likelyScore: "1-1",        // Conservative prediction based on scoring patterns
    halftimeResult: "0-0",     // First half tends to be more defensive
    overUnder: "Under 2.5",    // Based on average goals per match
    
    confidence: "MEDIUM",      // Mixed indicators, moderate confidence
    keyFactors: [
        "Both teams have similar defensive records",
        "Home advantage balanced by away team form",
        "Low-scoring league pattern"
    ],
    analysis: "Conservative match with both teams likely to focus on defensive stability"
};
```

### **Phase 4: Result Processing & Display**

#### **8. Data Validation & Formatting**
```javascript
// Validate and format the AI response
const processedPrediction = {
    // Ensure probabilities sum to 100%
    homeWinProbability: Math.max(0, Math.min(100, prediction.homeWinProbability)),
    drawProbability: Math.max(0, Math.min(100, prediction.drawProbability)),
    awayWinProbability: Math.max(0, Math.min(100, prediction.awayWinProbability)),
    
    // Validate score format
    likelyScore: validateScoreFormat(prediction.likelyScore),
    halftimeResult: validateScoreFormat(prediction.halftimeResult),
    
    // Process confidence level
    confidence: prediction.confidence || 'MEDIUM',
    riskLevel: confidenceToRiskLevel(prediction.confidence)
};
```

#### **9. Display Generation**
```javascript
// Generate the final display
const displayData = {
    matchDetails: {
        homeTeam: "Rodina Moskva",
        awayTeam: "Arsenal Tula", 
        league: "First League",
        venue: "Arena Khimki",
        location: "Khimki, Russia",
        time: "09/08/2025 16:30:00"
    },
    
    predictions: {
        homeWin: "35%",
        draw: "30%",
        awayWin: "35%",
        halftimeScore: "0-0",
        finalScore: "1-1",
        overUnder: "Under 2.5 goals"
    },
    
    confidence: "MEDIUM",
    riskLevel: "MEDIUM"
